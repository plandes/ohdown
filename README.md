# Find download URLs from OpenHub
I had to write this to find URLs for this project because we only wrote
our API to download the code from GitHub.

## Usage
You can compile with lein or use the compiled jar in the `binary` directory.

This will create/append `results.txt` and add downloaded XML to directory `down`.

Get usage:
```bash
$ java -jar binary/ohfinder-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar 
find	find for github URLs on OpenHub
  -a, --apikey STRING       Your 64 character OpenHub API key
  -s, --start NUMBER    1   Starting range (see Blackboard)
  -q, --queries NUMBER  25  Number of queries/downloads (you get 1000/day)
```

Invoke:
```bash
$ java -jar binary/ohfinder-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar find -a <APIKEY> -q 1
client: using API key: <0eb9e86d694602b9c3f32865b448eb3594ce45d9e9b961607a605b3b650fdfff>
client: starting at 1 for 1 queries
client: searching 1 - 2
client: checking ID: 1
client: url: http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html
client: complete for range: 1
```
